# Jacques Chirac

Jacques Chirac was a prominent French politician who served as the President of France from 1995 to 2007. Prior to his presidency, he held the positions of Prime Minister of France from 1974 to 1976 and 1986 to 1988, as well as Mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995. As the two-term French president, he was the first chief executive to acknowledge France's collaboration in the Holocaust and famously rejected U.S. calls to invade Iraq. Chirac's outspoken opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 had a significant impact on France's relations with its top ally.
